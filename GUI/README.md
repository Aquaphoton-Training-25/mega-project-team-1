# If you want only the backend logic or the .ui files then you will find these files in the "Raw Files" directory 
# If you want the whole Functioning Project then you will find it in the "Complete Project" directory
Important Note: You shoudn't alter any thing in this directory or the images and icons will not load as they depend on that relative path however, the main tasks in the GUI should work completely fine.
# If you want the track the development of our GUI style, you will find the older GUI versions in the "older versions" directory

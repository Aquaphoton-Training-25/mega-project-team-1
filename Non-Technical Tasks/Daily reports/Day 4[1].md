# Day 4 Report
## Hardware progression
- Started the schematic of the circuit which contains (sensors, indicator, RGB LEDS)
- Made a group discussion of the possible added indicators to the circuit
## Firmware Progression
- Started implementing PID concepi in autonomous mode
- ACS712 5A current sensor will be used.
- Hc-SR04 ultrasonic sensor will be used to easure distance from walls 

## Software progression
- Completely finished the video stitching (applied some image processing to improveÂ performance)
- modified the GUI to meet the task requirements
- finished the calibration of 3D stereo vision , the next step is rectification

# Day 2 Report


## Hardware progression

•    Started the schematic of the microcontroller PCB.

•	 Studied the communication protocol that will be used in connection between the GUI and microcontroller.

## Firmware progression
•	The pyFirmata library will be used in programming the ATmega328p and connecting it to the GUI via bluetooth.

• Studied how to burn bootloader to the ATmega328p and how to use an Arduino as an ISP to program the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.

## GUI progression
•   Interface layout is nearly completed and some feature were replaced from the old design.

•   GUI backend was discussed and some flowcharts are designed.

•   Video Stitching is approached by first implementing image stitching.

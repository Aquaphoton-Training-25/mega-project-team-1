# Day 5 Report
## Hardware Progression
- The schematic of the sensors and indicator pcb is almost finished 
- Done some modulation on the footprint of the microcontroller schematic
- Changed the built_in LED in the mc schematic due to a problem in the PCB routing
- Started the routing of the microcontroller circuit


## Firmware Progression
- Start writing the microcontroller code, focusing on the logic that enables the robot car to move parallel to the wall while maintaining a fixed distance using an ultrasonic  sensor and a PID controller.

-  Determine how these components will work together to accomplish the task.

- Study the connections between the sensors and the microcontroller to ensure proper integration.

## Software Progression
- Finished the rectification process of 3D stereo vision

- Nearly finished the integration of the Video Stitching in the GUI

- Worked on the backend of the Main Window and the backend of the Video Stitching Dialog window

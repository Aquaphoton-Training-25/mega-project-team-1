# Hardware Progression:
- A schematic for the ATmega328P microcontroller has been created.  -->(soad)

- Custom symbols and their footprints have been successfully designed. --> (soad)

# Firmware Progression:
- Began writing the firmware for the microcontroller. --> (ibrahim)

- Learned how to use the Arduino UNO to program the microcontroller & how to connect the bluetooth module (hc-05). --> (mazen)

# GUI Progression:
- nearly finished video stitching and started researching on how to integrate it in the GUI --> (Abdullah)

# copmuter vision :
-  detecting and matching features between two stereo images using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. This is a  step in understanding the spatial relationship between two views of the same scene. Successfully detected and matched keypoints between two stereo images, laying the groundwork for more advanced 3D reconstruction tasks. next step will involve estimating the Fundamental matrix to understand the epipolar geometry between the two images, followed by the computation of the Essential matrix 
This is a significant progress in applying computer vision techniques to 3D tasks, moving closer to the goal of understanding and reconstructing three-dimensional scenes from two-dimensional images. -->(malak)
